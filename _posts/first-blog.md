### Understanding each others responsibilities
#### Player Responsibilities
For the purpose of this paragraph i regard to the dm as a player too, precisely because they are also playing the game. 
A player should always show the other players, that they appreciate the time and work that everybody puts into the game. A respectful environment is needed for any game to thrive. Showing each other respect starts with things as: being on time for the game, not interrupting other players when they are talking, having your character ready to play. Of course there are exceptional cases, if you are being late atleast give the others a heads up. If you didn't finish building or leveling up your character, it's okay as long as you don't need half the session for it. 

#### DM Responsibilities 
The dungeon master (or game master) has the biggest responsibility of all. The dm is the glue holding the world together. You should try to plan a session that is fun for everybody at the table, it shouldn't be fun for only the players, but it also shouldn't be only for your entertainment. Having everybodies itches scratched leads to a happy group. You should encourage players to roleplay and encourage them to think about their backstory in between sessions. If you notice any player being talked over, ask them what they wanted to say.

The DM is the one controlling everything in the world, with the exception of the player characters of course. Never, ever control one of the characters, also don't assume what the characers would do in a cutscene. Atleast not if you don't know the character well enough to be 99.9% sure about what they would do. It's because the players only have control about one thing in this fictional world, and that's their character. It's really not a good feeling having the one thing you have control over taken away, trust me.

Other than that, go crazy, control that kingdom you built yourself, control the raiding orcs, control the weather. You can plan everything and nothing. A big part of dming is also improvisation. But there are many different dming styles, some write a few pages of dialog for a session, others know that the NPC is a female elf and they are good to go, being able to talk three hours from the elves perspective.
