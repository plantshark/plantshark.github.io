# Intro
I've only got 20 Pages and 10 Encounters planned, is that too little? I prepared for X but my players did Y, help?! How do you organize your Sessions? 
Those and many more similar questions float around the internet. Being a DM can lead to a certain degree of insecurity, but you shouldn't be insecure. You are a dungeon master, a master of dungeons, creator of worlds and destroyer of the same! Dragons and kraken appear at your will and will shiver in fear when you say so. 

Preparing for sessions is something every DM does differently, there are some that really want 20 pages of planned content with 10 encounters. And there are some that only need one phrase written on the back of a fast food bill. Finding out how much prep you need is a thing of habit, just try out different approaches until you find something that works for you. I don't want to tell experienced DM's that they do it wrong, or to tell inexperienced DM's how they will have to do it. I just want to give my readers an insight on how i do it, since i have found out what works best for me, and i feel it's a really good balance between invested work and reward. 

I try to keep my session notes tidy and simple. Two A4 Pages at most, most of the time its half a page to one page long. When you have your notes laying before you while running the session you want to see what's happening next and you want to know what you are currently doing without having to flip through a small novel. 
The exception of course are notes related to the session. Which include monster stat blocks, npc descriptions or fully fleshed out dungeons with all their traps and rooms.
Not long ago I ran a session where my players found a desperate woman alone on the street. She asked them to help rescue her husband who got kidnapped by a bunch of fire beasts. They tracked the beasts back to their dungeon and fought against burning insects, escaped hot steamy traps, allied with the kidnappers to defeat their tyrant leader who kept the husband in a cage. The whole dungeon took roughly two sessions, 4 hours each, to complete. 
My notes for those two sessions were one and a half pages describing the dungeon and nothing more. Those one and a half pages lasted for 8 hours of play! It took me roughly only one to two hours to write them up. So one hour of preparation for 4 hours of play, seems like a pretty good deal. So now i'll tell you what i keep in mind while preparing for a session.

# Keep it manageable
I'll think about where my players currently are, what they could do there, and where I want them to go next. 
If they currently are in a city and have to find a dwarven hermit somewhere in the mountains next, they might need a guide or maybe they want to buy climbing gear. It would be cool if they met a dwarf living in the city that tells them about the hermit, some interesting backstory why he is not with his clan. It will help the characters look forward to the hermit, Trekor Rockslide is no longer a name they have heard from the last NPC they met. It's now a name that has been mentioned twice, the hermit will feel more real, he is something that really exists in this world.

So I want the session to start in the city, having lots of NPCs talking with the players. Then i want them to go to the mountain range, is there a forest between mountains and city? Are there monsters inside it? Think about what would make this travelling part interesting. Your players just talked for the last 30-60 minutes, what would bring a nice change of pace? Let's say they are ambushed by wood elves which want to defend their forest from intruders, they are not hostile, but appear to be ready to release ten arrows into your players at the first sign of aggression. Your players can decide to fight them, or convince them that they mean no harm. You should not make the elves an invincible force. Prepare that your players will at least think about fighting every encounter you throw at them.

After they dealt with the elves they arrived at the base of the mountains. They will have to climb at some points, let them roll a few checks to see if they succeed without problems. Make it easier for them if they bought climbing gear in the city. You could plan an alternative encounter with some mountain bandits or monsters if your players resolved the wood elves encounter peacefully (some groups will yearn for at least one combat per session). And finally, maybe after a night's rest in a cave, they meet Trekor Rockslide, the hermit that can help them finish their quest.

Usually i want my session to end on a hook for the next session, i want to give them something to think about. Otherwise you might have disoriented players at the start of the next session. In my example you could have them finish the rest just to have Trekor appear in the morning, mysteriously standing in fron of them as the first sunshine begins to light up the cave. Or if you still want to play a little longer you could have him talk to them, explain that their quest is more than they think, they have to stop a great evil before its too late, you could reveal something big. And before your players spike Trekor with questions you end the session. But be aware, using cliffhangers every single session will be exhausting, if you use them too frequently your players won't care about them anymore.

# Complications
There are many ways to build in complications, they are after all what make the story interesting. If your players go from the city to the hermit without a problem they won't feel that they accomplished something. Players need to have something they can feel proud of. Your charismatic bard wants to find the best price for potions in the city, your druid wants to sympathize with the wood elves, your ranger wants to make the mountain climb easier and you barbarian wants to fight something. 

There are many forms of complications, the most common being a combat encounter. But everything that might drain resources from your players is a complication, having to persuade a guard might cost a charm spell. Dealing with an uncrossable river your druid has to shapeshift into a crocodile to get everyone across. I also like to use time as a resource in my campaigns. Every day something could happen in my world. If the players decide to take a few weeks off, some orc raiders can attack the village of a character's family, or some great thief guild could have stolen a powerful artifact from an archmage, starting a big war. 

I try to have at least one complication happen at every point of interest. Including settlements, forests, ruins, lakes or mountains. If no complications happen, I would at least have a small social encounter ready: "The players come across a river but there is a bridge, a human boy sits on the bridge with a fishing rod in his hand. Excitedly he asks them about their adventures before focusing on fishing again." or "The group rests in the spooky forest, suddenly thick fog appears out of nowhere, they all see ghostly appearances of animals jumping around them. A ghostly fox steals some of their provisions. After five seconds the fog disappears, and with it the animals."
Having little events like these just make the world feel more alive, the spooky forest has a backstory, even though it's one the players don't know about.

# Backstory Moments
Every time I prepare I also take a short look at all of my players' backstories again. I think about things that could happen this session and I could tie to one of their backstories. Could I tie the monks' monastery to the monastery they pass through this session? Will the veteran fighter know any of the guards stationed at the watchtower at the edge of civilisation?

It's important that the players feel like a part of your world. Otherwise they don't really care when something big happens. If a war wages between two nations and the families of your players are nothing more than names on paper, nobody cares if they die. But if your whole party met each family at least one and helped them in little side quests they will sacrifice everything they have got to save them from danger.

# Rewards
The first thing everybody will think about when hearing "rewards" will probably be magic items. But there is much more that you can give your players to make them feel rewarded. They can meet an important figure of an organization and gain a favor from them. They could do an act of great kindness and be rewarded with a blessing from the deity of charity. Think about what your players could gain until the end of the session that increases their power, directly or indirectly. An underappreciated reward in many DnD groups is inspiration, you can give the players a point of inspiration, which enables them to reroll a dice once. And lastly, the greatest reward of them all, levelling up. It's the best feeling of progression you can give your players.

# Improvisation
Always try to keep your session notes loosely tied together, so that you can leave room for improvisation and player choices. Try to not railroad your players straight down a path, without any choices that influence it. Of course, if it's important for your story, you can send them down a predefined path. But there should be many little choices (with differentiable consequences!) along it.

Improvisation is probably the greatest tool in a DM's toolkit. It pretty much defines how much preparation you need to run a smooth and pleasant session. It's something that needs a lot of training to master, but once you've got the hang of it, you will greatly increase the flow and fun of your sessions.

# NPC's
These are the people that make your world real, do them right and your campaign can be a lot more than a game, it can be a great story. For all important NPCs write down at least a few sentences on their appearance, behaviour, goals and flaws. It is definitely not required that you have a stat block for all NPC's your players meet. You also don't have to change your voice when speaking as a NPC, but try to give your speech a unique spin. Talk fast for a nervous NPC, talk slow and with long pauses for a wise old man or a really dumb ogre. You can speak grammatically incorrect for a foreigner or use fancy words for an aristocrat. 

# Conclusion
That's it. I hope i have given you some things to think about. After all, I want you to learn something, even if you say you definitely hate my approaches. You have learned that you don't want to do it like I do and that's a win for me.
