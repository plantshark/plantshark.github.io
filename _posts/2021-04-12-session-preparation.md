I prepared for X but my players did Y, help?! Questions like that float around the internet. Being a DM can lead to a certain degree of insecurity, but you shouldn't be insecure. You are a dungeon master, a master of dungeons, creator of worlds, and destroyer of the same! Dragons and Kraken appear at your will and will shiver in fear when you say so. 

Preparing for sessions is something every DM does differently, some want 20 pages of planned content with 10 encounters. And some only need one phrase written on the back of a fast-food bill. Finding out how much prep you need is a thing of habit, just try out different approaches until you find something that works for you. I don't want to tell experienced DM's that they do it wrong, or to tell inexperienced DM's how they will have to do it. I just want to give my readers an insight into how I do it, since I have found out what works best for me, and I feel it's a really good balance between invested work and reward. 

I try to keep my session notes tidy and simple. Two A4 Pages at most, most of the time it’s half a page to one page long. When you have your notes laying before you while running the session you want to see what's happening next and you want to know what you are currently doing without having to flip through a small novel. 
The exception of course are notes related to the session. Which include monster stat blocks, NPC descriptions, or fully fleshed out dungeons with all their traps and rooms.
Not long ago I ran a session where my players found a desperate woman alone on the street. She asked them to help rescue her husband who got kidnapped by a bunch of fire beasts. They tracked the beasts back to their dungeon and fought against burning insects, escaped hot steamy traps, allied with the kidnappers to defeat their tyrant leader who kept the husband in a cage. The whole dungeon took roughly two sessions, 4 hours each, to complete. 
My notes for those two sessions were one and a half pages describing the dungeon and nothing more. That one and a half pages lasted for 8 hours of play! It took me roughly only one to two hours to write them up. So one hour of preparation for 4 hours of play, seems like a pretty good deal. Now I’ll tell you what I keep in mind while preparing for a session, we'll work on an example session together.

# Keep it manageable
First, we think about where the players currently are, what they could do there, and where we want them to go next. 
Let's say they are currently in a city and have to find a dwarven hermit in the dreadful mountains, they might need a guide or maybe they want to buy climbing gear. It would be cool if they met a dwarf living in the city that tells them about the hermit, some interesting backstory of why he is not with his clan. It will help the characters look forward to the hermit, Trekor Rockslide is no longer a name they have heard from the last NPC they met. It's now a name that has been mentioned twice, the hermit will feel more real, he is something that exists in this world.

So we want the session to start in the city, having lots of NPCs talking with the players. Then we want them to go to the mountain range, is there a forest between the mountains and the city? Are there monsters inside it? Think about what would make this traveling part interesting. The players just talked for the last 30-60 minutes, what would bring a nice change of pace? Let's say they are ambushed by wood elves who want to defend their forest from intruders, they are not hostile but appear to be ready to release ten arrows into the players at the first sign of aggression. The players can decide to fight them, or convince them that they mean no harm. We should not make the elves an invincible force. Always prepare that the players will at least think about fighting every encounter we throw at them.

After they dealt with the elves they arrive at the base of the mountains. They will have to climb at some points, make them roll a few checks to see if they succeed without problems. Make it easier for them if they bought climbing gear in the city. You could plan an alternative encounter with some mountain bandits or monsters if the players resolved the wood elves encounter peacefully (some groups will yearn for at least one combat per session). And finally, maybe after a night's rest in a cave, they meet Trekor Rockslide, the hermit that can help them finish their quest.

Usually, I want my session to end on a hook for the next session, I want to give them something to think about. Otherwise, you might have disoriented players at the start of the next session. In my example we could have them finish the rest just to have Trekor appear in the morning, mysteriously standing in front of them as the first sunshine begins to light up the cave. Or if we still want to play a little longer we could have him talk to them, explain that their quest is more than they think, they have to stop a great evil before it’s too late, we could reveal something big. And before the players spike Trekor with questions we end the session. But be aware, using cliffhangers every single session will be exhausting, if we use them too frequently the players won't care about them anymore.

# Complications
There are many ways to build in complications, they are after what makes the story interesting. If the players go from the city to the hermit without a problem they won't feel that they accomplished something. Players need to have something they can feel proud of. The charismatic bard wants to find the best price for potions in the city, the druid wants to sympathize with the wood elves, the ranger wants to make the mountain climb easier and the barbarian wants to fight something. 

There are many forms of complications, the most common being a combat encounter. But everything that might drain resources from the players is a complication, having to persuade a guard might cost a charm spell. Dealing with an uncrossable river the druid has to shapeshift into a crocodile to get everyone across. I also like to use time as a resource in my campaigns. If the players want to stay with the wood elves and party for a few days, maybe the hermit is captured by the mountain bandits. And the players will now have to free him before being able to talk to him.

Try to have at least one complication happen at every point of interest. Including settlements, forests, ruins, lakes, or mountains. If no complications happen, at least have a small social encounter ready: "The players come across a river but there is a bridge, a human boy sits on the bridge with a fishing rod in his hand. Excitedly he asks them about their adventures before focusing on fishing again." or "The group rests in the spooky forest, suddenly thick fog appears out of nowhere, they all see ghostly appearances of animals jumping around them. A ghostly fox steals some of their provisions. After five seconds the fog disappears, and with it the animals."
Having little events like these just makes the world feel more alive, the spooky forest has a backstory, even though it's one the players don't know about.

# Backstory Moments
Every time I prepare a session I also take a short look at all of my players' backstories again. I think about things that could happen this session and I could tie them to one of their backstories. Could I tie the monks' backstory to a monastery that's nearby the hermit? Will the veteran fighter know any of the guards stationed at the watchtower at the edge of the wood elves territory?

It's important that the players feel like a part of your world. Otherwise, they don't care when something big happens. If war wages between two nations and the families of your players are nothing more than names on paper, nobody cares if they die. But if your whole party met each family at least one and helped them in little side quests, they will sacrifice everything they have to save them from danger.

<br>  

# Rewards
The first thing everybody will think about when hearing "rewards" will probably be magic items. But there are many more things you can give your players to make them feel rewarded. They could meet the king of the wood elves, help him with a problem and then gain a favor from him. They could do an act of great kindness by saving a beggar in the city and be rewarded with a blessing from the deity of charity. Think about what your players could gain until the end of the session that increases their power, directly or indirectly. An underappreciated reward in many DnD groups is inspiration, you can give the players a point of inspiration, which enables them to reroll a dice once. And lastly, the greatest reward of them all, leveling up. It's the best feeling of progression you can give your players.

<br>  

# Improvisation
Always try to keep your session notes loosely tied together, so that you can leave room for improvisation and player choices. Try to not railroad your players straight down a path, without any choices that influence it. Of course, if it's important for your story, you can send them down a predefined path. But there should be many little choices (with differentiable consequences!) along with it.

Improvisation is probably the greatest tool in a DM's toolkit. It pretty much defines how much preparation you need to run a smooth and pleasant session. It's something that needs a lot of training to master, but once you've got the hang of it, you will greatly increase the flow and fun of your sessions.

# NPC's
These are the people that make your world real, do them right and your campaign can be a lot more than a game, it can be a great story. For all important NPCs write down at least a few sentences on their appearance, behavior, goals, and flaws. It is not required that you have a stat block for all NPC's your players meet. You also don't have to change your voice when speaking as an NPC but try to give your speech a unique spin. Talk fast for a nervous NPC, talk slow and with long pauses for a wise old man or a dumb ogre. You can speak grammatically incorrect for a foreigner or use fancy words for an aristocrat. 

<br>  

# Conclusion
I guess what I want to say is, that everybody needs to find their own style, DMing is an art form, where the most important tool is improvisation. Try to deliberately leave little spaces in between your notes to be forced to improvise when you get to them.
That's it. I hope I have given you some things to think about. After all, I want you to learn something, even if you say you hate my approaches. You have learned that you don't want to do it as I do and that's a win for me.

# Written out Example
Here’s an example of the session I would have prepared in this blog post. As you can see there is a lot of space between the notes for improvisation. 


> Last session the party arrived in the city of Timbershield (farmlands around, lots of trading with food, many lower class citizens). They want to search Trekor Rockslide (Dwarven Hermit, 276y old, bald, braided grey beard, harsh exterior but good of hearth), a dwarf that fought the red dragon Chaldrus 100 years ago. He can tell them about the dragon’s lair and his weaknesses. 

> In the city they can buy climbing gear, there is a potion shop with potions (only rarities common-uncommon). They meet a dwarf named Umnan Oakbeard (Farmer, 120y old, filled with bitterness and pessimism) he tells them that he met Trekor a few times and the hermit has gone insane, he talks about a prophecy, the dragons will unite and destroy the world. Trekor was a respectable member of dwarven society, he was chosen to defeat Chaldrus the dragon but left the clan afterward, seemingly the encounter changed him a lot.

> There are a lot of thieves and beggars in the city, maybe someone tries to steal something from the players if the moment is right (DC 16 Perception check to notice).

> A few hours walk outside the city an elven forest begins, the wood elves are skeptical of outsiders and will ambush them, asking what they want, trying to get rid of intruders as soon as possible. They got orders to first try to talk peacefully (DC 15 Persuasion Check to convince the elves to let them pass), but they won’t hesitate to attack if any player talks about damaging the forest or harming animals inside (even if it’s said jokingly). Up to 8 elven archers (Scout stat block) attack, if at least 2 are slain, the elves retreat and leave the party alone.

> If the party fights the elves, they will retaliate as soon as the party rests inside or just outside the forest. If they resolved it peacefully, the elves help them get to the mountain range quicker and share their food with them.

> To climb the mountain the players will have to succeed on three climbing checks (they have Advantage on the rolls with climbing gear).
DC 13 Athletics Check => 2d4 bludgeoning damage on a fail
DC 16 Athletics Check => 5d4 bludgeoning damage + 1 exhaustion level on a fail 
DC 14 Athletics Check => 3d4 bludgeoning damage on a fail

> If they make a lot of noise, they could attract bandits (1x Bandit Captain, 1x Archer, 5 Bandits).

> At the end of the day they should meet Trekor Rockslide, he either comes to them or they have to find him, depending on where and when they rest.

> Trekor Rockslide will tell them about a prophecy. After fighting Chaldrus 100 years ago, he nearly got burned alive. He managed to jump into a river and survive. His wounds were really bad, thus he was in a mixed state of sleep and being awake, after a day he started to have a weird vision about more dragons, about burning cities. He saw a volcano, which contained the heart of fire, a legendary artifact that allows one to take control of red dragons, they have to take every command from the wielder of the artifact. Trekor wants the characters to travel to the volcano and save the world.
