I first played Dungeons and Dragons in 2014 (i think), ever since then i've been in love with it.  </br>
At heart i am a Dungeon Master, but i really enjoy being a Player and just diving deep into that immersion.

## Goals of this Blog
With the help of my blog, everybody should be able to tell a better story in their Pen & Paper RPG game.    </br>
But it's not just all about the in-game world, it's also about the people that play in said world, often more so than about the fictional characters. 

In my opinion the journey to grow as a player, dungeon master and overall as a person never ends.   </br>
Every experience you have eventually leads to a better self.

### Keep in mind
{: .box-warning}
Everything i write about here is my own opinion, everybody has one of those. But i'm not really protective of mine, whenever you don't agree with it please let me know in a constructive message.
