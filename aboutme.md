Ever since i started playing dungeons and dragons i've been in love with it. At heart i am a dungeon master, but i also really enjoy being a player and just diving deep into that immersion.

## Goals of this Blog
With the help of my blog everybody should be able to tell a better story in their Pen & Paper / Tabletop RPG game. But it's not just all about the in-game world, it's also about the people that play in said world, often more so than about the fictional characters. 

In my opinion the journey to grow as a player, dungeon master and overall as a person never ends. Everything you experience and learn eventually leads to a better self.

**Keep in mind:** Everything i write about here is my own opinion, everybody has one of those. But i'm not really protective of mine, whenever you don't agree with it please let me know in a constructive message.
