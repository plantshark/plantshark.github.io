## Scenery

I don’t know if this fits here but I think a lot of TTRPG games are missing this, so I want to talk about it. A scene is a moment where the players pause, but the whole world starts moving. You describe how they get on top of the hill just to see the steppes they have been traveling to in the distance. There is no cover in the steppes, it’s just flat land as wide as they can see. There is a hoard of bison, seemingly in search of water, a few of them are falling behind, too weak to keep up the travel. It’s a harsh land, wild beasts are roaming the lands. In the distance they hear a war horn, it seems there are not only animals living here. Try to give them something that instantly tells them something about the place they are. Include their senses, do they notice the subtle smell of oil when entering a gnome tinker city? Do they hear the seagull’s in the fisher village? How does the ground feel when they enter the swamp? For example, I want you to imagine what a small village inhabited by elven farmers would look like on the morning day of their harvests festival. Ask yourself how you would feel if you stood in the middle of it.
I’d like to think all this gives the world more credibility, that you don’t just imagine it, but that you rather exist in it. A scene should not create a dire complication, it should show the players what complications they might encounter in the area they are.
