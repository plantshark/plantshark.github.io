### 1. Understanding each others areas of responsibilities
#### 1.1 Player Responsibilities
For the purpose of this paragraph i always regard to the dm as a player too, precisely because they are playing the game too. A player should always show the other players, that they appreciate the time and work that everybody puts into the game. A respectful environment is needed for any game to thrive. Showing each other respect starts with things as: being on time for the game, not interrupting other players when they are talking, having your character ready to play. Of course there are  exceptional cases, if you are being late atleast give the others a heads up. If you didn't finish building or leveling up your character, it's okay as long as you don't need half the session to finish it. 

#### 1.2 DM Responsibilities
The dungeon master (or game master) has maybe the biggest responsibility of all players. The dm is the glue holding the session together, as a dm you should always keep the game running. You should try to plan a session that is fun for ALL players on the table, it shouldn't be fun for only the players, but it most definitely shouldn't be only for your entertainment. You should encourage players to roleplay and encourage them to think about their backstory in between sessions. If you notice any player being talked over, ask them what they wanted to say.

The DM is the one controlling everything in the world, with the exception of the player characters of course. Never, ever control one of the characters, also don't assume what the characers would do in a cutscene. Atleast not if you don't know the character well enough to be 99.9% sure about what they would do. It's because the players only have control about one thing in this fictional world, and that's their character. It's really not a good feeling having the one thing you have control over taken away, trust me.

Other than that, go crazy, control that kingdom you built yourself, control the raiding orcs, control the weather. You can plan everything and nothing. A big part of dming is also improvisation. But there are many different dming styles, some write a few pages of dialog for a session, others know that the NPC is a female elf and they are good to go, being able to talk three hours from the elves perspective. 


### 2. Before the game
#### 2.2 Character 101
You don't have to do a cool voice, or have five pages of backstory for your character. However, you should atleast know the basics about your character, what family and friends do they have? Where did they grow up? How did they learn fighting? Are they good hearted or would they murder a child for a snickers? The last one might seem extreme in some eyes, but many people like playing an asshole for once. Being nice in real life is tedious enough, why not be the cool badass guy in game that i always wanted to be? Well, you will eventually talk to other player characters with your character. And even if its only in a fantasy world, being harassed, insulted and overall treated badly is not a good feeling. Of course i don't want to say that you should only play characters that are the nicest of the nice but atleast tweak your character a little bit. Your character might be a little rough around the edges, but i recommend always having a character that is at it's core, a very nice and sweet person. Obviously those are only guidelines for players that don't have much experience, if your group is comfortable with it and everybody knows how to handle it, you can all play the evilest of evil characters and might have the time of your life. 

As for the mechanical aspect, being able to act fast, and not having to re-read the same ability for the tenth time is a blessing. Try to know your to-go abilities like the back of your hand. The whole group will thank you. If all players know their abilities and attacks, it's the difference between having a tedious and long fight or a fast paced action sequence.


### 3. In the game
#### Playing together
As i already said before, try having characters that are not all obnoxious. You are all at this table playing a game because you are friends in real life, why not be friends in the game too? For example, when you notice that you have gotten all the attention of the table for the last 10 minutes, try to bring another character into the spotlight. Sharing is caring, after all. 


#### 3.2 Pacing
The whole group should try to pace the game, the dm should keep tension high, but also relieve it for breather. The players should act fast in combat to keep the pacing, but also take their time in an emotional scene with their beloved NPC wife. Pacing is the rarely spoken about thing that really makes a difference. If a fight takes too long, the players loose interest in the session and start stacking dice. If the combat is over too fast the players are dissapointed because their tension couldn't be relieved in a fulfilling fashion. 

### 4. After the game
#### 4.1 Thanks, but...
After an exhausting session many just want to go home and sleep. After a high stakes session you might want to stay a bit longer and talk about what happened. In both cases you should all be grateful to each other that you shared this wonderful time. But sometimes that time wasn't wonderful, maybe one thing happened in this session that bugged and distracted you until the end. Therefore it's always a good idea to give each other, not just the dm, feedback about what you liked and didn't like. But please stay constructive and friendly. 

#### 4.2 Dealing with "the dread"
Sometimes you question yourself after the game, as a player you think maybe you were too harsh to someone else. Or maybe you felt stepped on your toes because someone else was harsh to you? As a dm you might think something like: "Am i good enough? Did the players have fun?". Thats why you should talk to each other, tell each other what a great, or not so great time you had, and how you think you all can improve for a better session next time.
