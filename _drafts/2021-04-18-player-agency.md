An important task for DMs is to create a player agency. Meaning, the players should be encouraged and motivated to act independently and to make their own choices. They shouldn’t do what they think you want them to. So how do you handle this as a DM? I can give you some basic ideas on how to tackle this task, and hope you can enhance those ideas. 


## Part of the world, not just part of a game
In order to create agency, it’s easier if players create a backstory for their character. Some basic ideas on why this character is where they are now. Who are their family, friends, enemies? Where and how did they grow up? What short and long-term goals do they have?
Players should create their own backstory, you should not create it for them. 
It's important that the players feel like a part of your world. Otherwise, they don't care when something big happens. If war wages between two nations and the families of your players are nothing more than names on paper, nobody cares if they die. But if your whole party met each family at least once and helped them in little side quests, they will sacrifice everything they have to save them from danger.

## Tying the backstory to the story 
It’s a good idea to make one big important thread of each characters backstory and tie it to the story you have prepared for the adventure. For example, the story anticipates for the players to go to a foreign land, while there the ranger of the group discovers that their long-lost father still lives, being hold captive by the foreign king. Make sure that not all ties come into action at once, rather try to chain them one after another. Sometimes it’s fun to tie two or three backstories of players directly together, maybe the warlock patron is the demon that kidnapped the fighter’s brother so many years ago, that was the reason why the fighter became an adventurer. 

## Don’t just think big, sometimes it’s the little things
As always, I am a big fan of creating immersion, of giving the world more credibility. To achieve that, you should also tie many small details in your sessions to the players. Since your player’s characters existed long in this world before you started playing, they all have places where they already went, they have a reputation in some areas, be it good or bad. Other NPC’s could know them and react to them. When the party is refused entry to the city, the veteran fighter could be an old comrade of the guard at the city gates, allowing them to enter the city. Maybe the party meets the paladin’s foster parents and they tell the paladin that their parents still live, creating another thread to the paladin’s backstory. Sometimes it’s the other way around, the party is sitting peacefully in the tavern, drinking some ale, as suddenly a thug puts a knife to the rogue’s throat, demanding the gold that the rogue stole from the thug’s boss a few years ago. 

## Sharing is caring
I feel that this point is also important and is often overlooked. A player’s backstory should not just be his own until the end of the campaign. Every time the players show interest in each other’s backstory, the cohesiveness of the party grows. That’s why you should introduce NPC’s from one character’s backstory to the whole party. The one old friend that taught the orphan sorcerer how to control their powers could be the person the party has to meet in order to learn more about the evil powers threatening the land. But it doesn’t always have to be high stakes. Maybe your party travels through the lands of the monk’s monastery, and they stop by for the night. Just sharing stories with the monk’s old teachers and friends, drinking wine together, just having a good time. 

## Don’t take away agency
A problem I’ve had myself once was that I was so eager to create agency, that I accidentally took it away instead. One time a player of mine joined a campaign later than the rest. He played a barbarian and I thought a fun and fitting way to introduce the barbarian was to let him appear in a big boom. Having him crash through the door into the house the other players currently were. The problem was that the player wanted his character to be more introverted, the character would have never done this. Thus I killed the fun for this one player, he even left the campaign after this session. The players only have one thing in your world to control, and that’s their character, only meddle directly with a character when you are 100% sure on how the player would want things to go.
